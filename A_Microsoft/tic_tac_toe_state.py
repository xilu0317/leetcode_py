#  When turns is 1, X moved.When turns is 0, O moved.rows stores the number of X or O in each row.
#  cols stores the number of X or O in each column.
#  diag stores the number of X or O in diagonal.
#  antidiag stores the number of X or O in antidiagonal.
#  When any of the value gets to 3, it means X wins.
#  When any of the value gets to - 3, it means O wins.

#  When X wins, O cannot move anymore, so turns must be 1.
#  When O wins, X cannot move anymore, so turns must be 0.
#  Finally, when we return, turns must be either 0 or 1, and X and O cannot win at same time.
